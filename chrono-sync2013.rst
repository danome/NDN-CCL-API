ChronoSync2013 Class
====================

.. container:: experimental

    .. admonition:: Experimental

       The support for ChronoSync is experimental and the API is not finalized.

    A ChronoSync2013 implements the NDN ChronoSync protocol as described in the
    2013 paper [ChronoSync 2013] "Letâ€™s ChronoSync: Decentralized Dataset
    State Synchronization in Named Data Networking".
    http://named-data.net/publications/chronosync

    :[C++]:
        | ``#include <ndn-cpp/sync/chrono-sync2013.hpp>``
        | Namespace: ``ndn``

    :[Java]:
        Package: ``net.named_data.jndn.sync``

    As in [ChronoSync2013], we describe the ChronoSync protocol using
    the example of ChronoChat, a chat application.

    As described in [ChronoSync 2013] section III.B "Naming Rules",
    a ChronoSync application uses two types of name prefixes: A broadcast
    prefix for sync state messages that update the current sequence number of
    each publisher, and an application data prefix used to fetch the
    application-specific data from a producer. These prefixes are given to
    the ChronoSync2013 constructor as `applicationBroadcastPrefix` and
    `applicationDataPrefix`.
    
    Similar to the example in [ChronoSync 2013] Fig. 3b, an application
    broadcast prefix for the chat room "lunch-talk" would be
    "/ndn/broadcast/ChronoChat-0.3/lunch-talk".
    
    In [ChronoSync 2013] Fig. 3a, the example application data prefix
    is "/wonderland/alice/chronos/lunch-talk", where
    "/wonderland/alice/chronos" is a prefix under which the user is allowed to
    publish application data. For our ChronoChat implementation, we always
    prompt the user for a "hub prefix" under which the user is allowed to
    pubish, for example "/ndn/edu/ucla/remap". Also, instead of putting the
    actual user name in the data prefix, we generate a random string at
    application startup, for example "GL7VUW32Ft". So, the application data
    prefix for the chat room "lunch-talk" would be 
    "/ndn/edu/ucla/remap/lunch-talk/GL7VUW32Ft".

    In ChronoChat, each publisher publishes a sequence of data packets, and
    at any point in time each publisher has a maximum sequence number. The
    purpose of the ChronoSync2013 class is to track the current sequence number
    of each publisher, and to announce a new sequence number when the local
    application publishes new data. (Sequence numbers only increase, so the
    current sequence number is always the maximum.) As described in
    [ChronoSync 2013], ChronoSync2013 accomplishes this by maintaining a
    "digest tree" with an entry for each publisher and their current (maximum)
    sequence number.
    
    In the digest tree in [ChronoSync 2013] Fig. 4, the node for each publisher
    has a "name prefix" and "maximum sequence number". The "name prefix" is
    the same as the `applicationDataPrefix` that each ChronoChat application
    gives to its ChronoSync2013 constructor. In our implementation, we
    say "current sequence number" instead of "maximum sequence number. In our
    implementation, we also add a separate "session number", which is based on
    the timestamp at application start-up. (The application gives this to the
    ChronoChat2013 constructor as `sessionNo`.) This would be a separate field
    for each node in [ChronoSync 2013] Fig. 4, so that the node digest is
    computed over "application data prefix" + "session number" + "current
    sequence number". As in [ChronoSync 2013], the ChronoSync2013 class computes
    the digest of each node in the tree (sorted on "application data prefix" +
    "session number") and then computes the "root digest" over each node digest.

    As described in [ChronoSync 2013] section III.D, the ChronoSync2013 class
    keeps an outstanding interest for the root digest of the digest tree, so
    that another application will answer with a data packet when it publishes
    data under a new sequence number. For example, if the current root digest is
    "74d13bb1081d457b5798f796399a7833657fe6ea65b7a6891c07f84fc7c26e93" and using
    the application broadcast prefix above, then the outstanding interest would be
    "/ndn/broadcast/ChronoChat-0.3/ndnchat/74d13bb1081d457b5798f796399a7833657fe6ea65b7a6891c07f84fc7c26e93",
    where the interest lifetime is `syncLifetime` given to the ChronoSync2013
    constructor. (Note that the root digest of an empty tree at startup is
    always "00".)

    When another application answers this interest with a sync state message,
    ChronoSync2013 updates its internal digest tree, computes a new root digest
    and expresses an outstanding interest with the new root digest for a new
    sync state message.  It also calls the onReceivedSyncState callback given to the
    constructor to provide the application with a list of
    :ref:`SyncState <ChronoSync2013.SyncState>` objects. For example, the
    SyncState data prefix (of the other application) is
    "/ndn/edu/ucla/remap/lunch-talk/48nQn3KyXV", the session number
    (of the other application) is 1405718551, and the new sequence number
    is 791. In this case, the ChronoChat application would express an interest for
    "/ndn/edu/ucla/remap/lunch-talk/48nQn3KyXV/1405718551/791". (This is
    similar to the full example chat data name in [ChronoSync 2013] Fig. 3a.)
    The other ChronoChat application will receive this interest and send the
    application-specific content, for example containing a chat message or
    a "leave" announcement, which ChronoChat displays to the user.

    Finally, when the application wants to publish data, it calls the
    ChronoSync2013 method `publishNextSequenceNo()` which increments the
    current application sequence number, creates a sync message with the new
    sequence number and publishes a data packet where the name is the
    applicationBroadcastPrefix plus the root digest of the current digest tree.
    (This is the data packet which answers the outstanding interest from other
    applications for a sync state update.) ChronoChat2013 then adds this sync
    message to its internal digest tree which creates a new root digest.
    Then it expresses an interest for the next sync update with
    the name applicationBroadcastPrefix plus the new root digest. After the
    application calls this method, it calls :ref:`getSequenceNo() <getSequenceNo>`
    to get the new sequence number generated by `publishNextSequenceNo()` and
    publishes the application-specific content for the this sequence number.

    In addition to the above operations, each time that ChronoSync2013 receives
    or generates a new set of sync state messages for a particular root digest, it
    saves this in a "digest log" as described in [ChronoSync 2013] section III.C
    and uses it to respond to a "recovery" interest as described in section
    III.F "Handling network partitions".

    When the ChronoSync2013 class sends a sync state message, the content of the
    data packet needs a way to encode the sync state. So, it uses a Google protocol
    buffer (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
    encoding using the definition in sync-state.proto
    (https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cpp/blob/master/src/sync/sync-state.proto)
    which specifies `applicationDataPrefix` as the name, along with the session
    number and sequence number. (Note that the
    :ref:`SyncState <ChronoSync2013.SyncState>` object has the same fields but
    is defined separately so that the API is not dependent on the specifics of
    the protocol buffer code.)

    Likewise, the application can define its own message format for the content
    in the application-specific data packet. So, the ChronoChat example uses a
    protocol buffer encoding using the definition in chatbuf.proto
    (https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cpp/blob/master/tests/chatbuf.proto)
    which specifies a message type of CHAT, HELLO, LEAVE and JOIN, along with
    details for each message type. The application-specific message is cleanly
    separated from the core sync state message used by ChronoChat2013.

ChronoSync2013 Constructor
--------------------------

.. container:: experimental

    .. admonition:: Experimental

       The support for ChronoSync is experimental and the API is not finalized.

    Create a new ChronoSync2013 to communicate using the given face. Initialize
    the digest log with a digest of "00" and and empty content. Register the
    applicationBroadcastPrefix to receive interests for sync state messages and
    express an interest for the initial root digest "00".

    .. note::

        [except JavaScript] Your application must call :ref:`processEvents <processEvents>`.
        Since processEvents modifies the internal ChronoSync data structures, your
        application should make sure that it calls processEvents in the same
        thread as this constructor (which also modifies the data structures).

            )

    :[Java]:

        .. code-block:: java

            public ChronoSync2013(
                OnReceivedSyncState onReceivedSyncState,
                OnInitialized onInitialized,
                Name applicationDataPrefix,
                Name applicationBroadcastPrefix,
                long sessionNo,
                Face face,
                KeyChain keyChain,

                double syncLifetime,
                OnRegisterFailed onRegisterFailed
            )

    :Parameters:

        - `onReceivedSyncState`
            When ChronoSync receives a sync state message this calls
            onReceivedSyncState(syncStates, isRecovery) where:

            - `syncStates`
                is the list of :ref:`SyncState <ChronoSync2013.SyncState>` messages.
            - `isRecovery`
                is true if this is the initial list of SyncState messages or from
                a recovery interest. (For example, if isRecovery is true, a chat
                application would not want to re-display all the associated chat
                messages.) The callback should send interests to fetch the
                application data for the sequence numbers in the sync state.

        - `onInitialized`
            This calls onInitialized() when the first sync data is received (or
            the interest times out because there are no other publishers yet).

        - `applicationDataPrefix`
            The prefix used by this application instance for application data.
            For example, "/my/local/prefix/ndnchat4/0K4wChff2v". This is used
            when sending a sync message for a new sequence number. In the sync
            message, this uses applicationDataPrefix.toUri().

        - `applicationBroadcastPrefix`
            The broadcast name prefix including the application name. For
            example, "/ndn/broadcast/ChronoChat-0.3/ndnchat1". This makes a copy
            of the name.

        - `sessionNo`
            The session number used with the applicationDataPrefix in sync state
            messages.

        - `face`
            The :ref:`Face <Face>` for calling registerPrefix and expressInterest.
            The Face object must remain valid for the life of this
            ChronoSync2013 object.

        - `keyChain`
            To sign a data packet containing a sync state message, this calls
            keyChain.sign(data, certificateName).

        - `certificateName`
            The certificate name of the key to use for signing a data packet
            containing a sync state message.

        - `syncLifetime`
            The interest lifetime in milliseconds for sending sync interests.

        - `onRegisterFailed`
            If failed to register the prefix to receive interests for the
            `applicationBroadcastPrefix`, this calls
            onRegisterFailed(applicationBroadcastPrefix).

.. _getProducerSequenceNo:

            The producer data prefix as a Name URI string.

        - `sessionNo`
            The producer session number.

    :Returns:

        The current producer sequence number, or -1 if the producer namePrefix
        and sessionNo are not in the digest tree.

.. _getSequenceNo:

ChronoSync2013.getSequenceNo Method
-----------------------------------

.. container:: experimental

    .. admonition:: Experimental

        .. code-block:: java

            public final long getSequenceNo()

    :Returns:

        The sequence number.

.. _publishNextSequenceNo:

ChronoSync2013.publishNextSequenceNo Method
-------------------------------------------

.. container:: experimental

    .. admonition:: Experimental

       The support for ChronoSync is experimental and the API is not finalized.

    Increment the sequence number, create a sync message with the new sequence
    number and publish a data packet where the name is the
    applicationBroadcastPrefix + the root digest of the current digest tree.
    Then add the sync message to the digest tree and digest log which creates a
    new root digest. Finally, express an interest for the next sync update with
    the name applicationBroadcastPrefix + the new root digest. After this, your
    application should publish the content for the new sequence number. You can
    get the new sequence number with :ref:`getSequenceNo() <getSequenceNo>`.

    .. note::

        [except JavaScript] Your application must call :ref:`processEvents <processEvents>`.  
        Since processEvents modifies the internal ChronoSync data structures, your
        application should make sure that it calls processEvents in the same
        thread as publishNextSequenceNo (which also modifies the data structures).

    :[C++]:

        .. code-block:: c++

            void publishNextSequenceNo();

    :[JavaScript]:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            ChronoSync2013.prototype.publishNextSequenceNo = function()

    :[Java]:

        .. code-block:: java

            public final void publishNextSequenceNo()

ChronoSync2013.shutdown Method
------------------------------

.. container:: experimental

    .. admonition:: Experimental

       The support for ChronoSync is experimental and the API is not finalized.

    Unregister callbacks so that this does not respond to interests anymore.
    If you will dispose this ChronoSync2013 object while your application is
    still running, you should call shutdown() first.  After calling this, you
    should not call publishNextSequenceNo() again since the behavior will be
    undefined.

    .. note::

        [except JavaScript] Because this modifies internal ChronoSync data
        structures, your application should make sure that it calls
        processEvents in the same thread as shutdown() (which also modifies the
        data structures).

    :[C++]:

        .. code-block:: c++

            void shutdown();

    :[JavaScript]:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            ChronoSync2013.prototype.shutdown = function()
